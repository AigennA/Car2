# Car2

## Overview
This is a simple C# console application that demonstrates basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The project defines a `Car2` class and uses it to create and interact with multiple car objects.

## Features
- Define a car with `Brand`, `Color`, and `MaxSpeed`
- Display car information using `ShowInfo()`
- Simulate driving with `Drive()`
- Create multiple car objects and interact with them

## Code Structure
- `Car2.cs`: Contains the `Car2` class with fields and methods
- `Program.cs`: Main entry point where car objects are created and used

## Example Output

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or any C# IDE
3. Build and run the application

## Learning Goals
- Understand classes and objects
- Practice using fields and methods
- Learn how to structure simple OOP programs in C#
